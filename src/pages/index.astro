          Hi, I'm Max! I'm a self-taught software developer with a strong will
          to learn, research new technologies, and design software architecture.
          I like creating practical business solutions and making development
          processes as efficient as possible. Currently, I'm working as an
          Associate Software Developer at{" "}
          <a class="text-blue-800" href="https://www.logicmanager.com">
            LogicManager
          </a>{" "}
          where I work with frontend and backend technologies in an agile environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm working on growing my skills and gaining exposure to a variety of
          technology, whether that be through work or personal projects. When
          I'm not glued to my computer, I enjoy playing the guitar, chess, and
          learning languages. Also, I believe in hard work, curiosity, and
          diversity.
